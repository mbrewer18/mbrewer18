### Hi I'm Mollie, 👋

I'm an exercise physiologist turned aspiring computer scientist. Currently embarking on an exciting journey as a PhD student in computer science at the University of Florida. 
I am passionate about bridging the gap between sport science and technology. 🏃💻

With a deep understanding of exercise physiology, I've taken on the exciting challenge of learning to code.

I'm devoted to empowering athletes and coaches by developing tools that make interpreting complex data straightforward and actionable. The aim is to unlock new levels of athletic success through the power of data-driven insights. 📊🏆

Here on GitHub, I'm excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to projects that stand at the intersection of sports science and computer science. Let's push the boundaries of what's possible in athletic performance together! 🚀🤝
